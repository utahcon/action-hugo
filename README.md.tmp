# action-hugo

The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites now has a Github Action that's just as fast! Why wait for Hugo to
**build** each time you build your site? `utahcon/action-hugo` uses pre-built Docker containers to run your Hugo builds.
You can even leverage them without Github Actions: [see here](https://hub.docker.com/utahcon/hugo)

## Usage
Simple to use, just add a step as follows:

```yaml
- name: Hugo Build
  uses: utahcon/actions-hugo@%%LATEST%%
```

## Flexible
Each version allows you to pass in the appropriate command line arguments through `inputs`

| Name | Type | Description |
